https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp

### Purpose of this workshop
Get a feel of basic HTML and CSS while recreating a simple and nice Medium article design.
Focus on text styling, basic layout and header image.

### Steps
- Plan your work.  
  What will we need? Gather content, images, run through basic HTML structure, gather info for styling.
- Keep things tidy.  
  Create a folder for all your Greenfox materials, within it a folder for the first week, within it a folder for the first day assignment.
- Start with the content.  
  Create an index.html file. What are the mandatory tags in an HTML document? See [step1 in the project folder](project/step1)  
  Add some content. Copy-paste a few paragraphs of text from [the article above](https://medium.com/galleys/how-she-got-there-3a64d89ba112#.8eknq2olp) to start with.
- Give it some structure.  
  What semantic role do these paragraphs fill? Divide it into a few separate HTML tags.
- Give it some style.  
  Create a style.css file and link it to your HTML.  
  What text styles do we need to get closer to the Medium article's look?  
  How do you center content on the page?  
  Try adding a custom font via [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Merriweather).  
- Add a header image.  
  Try adding an image tag. How do you make it full page wide?  
  Try adding the image as background-image instead.
